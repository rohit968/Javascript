//if-else statement

let num = 18;

if (num > 19) { //Checks the condition and returs a value whether truthy or falsy(refer class number 11)
  console.log("Greater than 19"); // if condition is true then only this block will execute
} else {
  console.log("Lesser than 19"); // if condition is false then only this block will execute
}

// output: "Lesser than 19". as value of num is less than 19 so the condition becomes false and else block is run
