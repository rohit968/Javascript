let i = 0

do {
  console.log(i);
  i++
} while (i <= 9)

// Works similar as while loop just the difference is if the condition is false in the first time the loop will be executed for the 1st time.
//Right now the output is 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

//but if we keep i = 100
//It will print 100 one time and then will stop the execution of the loop
