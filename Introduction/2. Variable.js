"use strict" //This prevents us from making mistakes in javascript

// Variables can store some information which can be used and change later.

//Declaring a variable using keyword var
var name = "Rohit"

//Can also create variable without using any keyword.
//But this is not recommended as it may cause problems
//We can save ourselves from this by using "use strict"
var age = 28

//Using a variable
console.log(name);
console.log(age);

//Changing a variable
name = "Tiwari"
console.log(name);

//Conventions for naming a variable
//cannot start with number or use spaces
// EX: 1value / value1 / first name / (these all are invalid)
//can use only underscore and dollar symbol in special characters
//EX: first_name / _firstname / last$name / $lastname = (valid)
//use camelCase naming

var firstName = "Rohit"
