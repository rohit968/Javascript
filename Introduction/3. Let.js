//Declaring variable using let keyword

let name = "Rohit Tiwari";
console.log(name);

//For changing the variable
name = "Tiwari Rohit"
console.log(name)

//For changing in var we can again use the keyword in front of variable name
//EX: var name = "Rohit"
//FOr changing: var name ="Tiwari"
// THis will change the value of name
//But we cannot use this in case of let as it will give error of "Name is already been declared"


//let name = "Tiwari" //Run this to see error
